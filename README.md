# Detecting-Cancer-by-Computer-Vision

This is the project I did with one of my classmate in Applid Deep Learning at Columbia in Fall 2022. In this project, we deployed deep learning model to classify patches extracted from the medical images at different levels of magnification and use our model to produce heat maps of tumor from probability. The inspiration of the model is from this paper by a group from Google (https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02442.)

The dataset is from the CAMELYON16 (https://camelyon17.grand-challenge.org/Data/).
